	abstract = {We present an experimental and theoretical study of electron
		ionization (EI) of Cyclopropylamine (CPA) molecule, using crossed
		electron – molecular beam technique with mass spectrometric detection
		of the ions.
		We have obtained energy resolved mass spectra,
		and electron energy dependent ion efficiency curves for ions
		of particular mass charge ratios (m/z).
		Except the ionization energy of the CPA molecule (8.46 ± 0.20 eV)
		we have evaluated the appearance energies of most of the ions
		in the mass spectrum formed via dissociative ionization (DI) processes.
		In addition we have carried out He∗ photoelectron spectrometry (PES)
		and determined the vertical ionization energy (VIE) of 9.47 ± 0.1 eV
		and detected the excited states of CPA. PES study was supported
		by outer valence green function (OVGF) calculation of the vertical
		ionization energy (9.55 eV).
		We have carried out quantum-chemical calculations of the neutral
		molecule, of the molecular ions, the neutral and ionic fragments
		and the reaction enthalpies for the DI processes were calculated.
		The theoretical DI values were applied for identification
		of the DI reactions and fragment ions in experiment.}
